## Joke Teller 😆
A Joke telling machine built on JS

When user click ***Crack a new joke*** the machine gets random jokes 🃏 from *third party API* and converts them to speech using *voiceRSS **text-to-speech** API*. Built with JavaScript (ES6) 

**Credit to great resources that I used**: 🌼

**Cool things that I learned in this project:** 🎉
 ***Try..catch***    This is the most common way to handle errors when using **async-await**. All we have to do is encapsulate our code in a **try {block}** and handle any errors that occur in a **catch{...}**.
