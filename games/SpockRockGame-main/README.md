## Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock
A game similar to rock, paper, scissors.

see this big bang video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=405Nh2H4Ucg

In this game,  the user will click on one of the icons to select their weapon. And then there will be logic *("Match.random()")* that will allow the PC to make a **random selection** and then it will evaluate which player won or if they choose the same thing there is a tie between the player and the PC.

This project is also mobile, responsive. üì±

**Credit for great resources that I used:**
1. Third party confett üéâ is created by using *moodules* to import into the JavaScript: https://www.cssscript.com/confetti-falling-animation/
2. Beautyful icons *Ô∏è‚É£ from Fontello.com.
3. Nice-looking fonts from google (the "Indie-flower" font was chosen by my daughter üëß :>  ).


**New cool things that I learn:**
1. To make any container looks mordern: use this CSS combination ‚òëÔ∏è
     * box-shadow: 0 10px 20px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
     * border-radius: 10px;
2. The *switch statement* is used to perform different actions based on different conditions: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp
3. Include *<type="module">* in the <script> element, to declare script as a *module*. This help clear the consusion of placing the JS scripts in order.
